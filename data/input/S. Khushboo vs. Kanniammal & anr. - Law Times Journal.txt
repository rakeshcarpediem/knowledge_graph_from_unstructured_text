['The discussion on premarital sex in Indian Society is like throwing a lit match into a pail of gasoline. It has always been in contention for being a topic of obscenity. This case is one of the important cases because it deals with the question of protection of fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression and it also clarified the criteria to check the obscenity of any statement. The Supreme Court stated that obscenity should be gauged with respect to contemporary community standards that reflected the sensibilities as well as the tolerance levels of an average reasonable person.\xa0', 'The Supreme Court held that there is no prima facie case of defamation in the present case. The court also found that the institution of the numerous criminal complaints against the Appellant was done in a mala fide manner. In order to prevent the abuse of the criminal law machinery, it would be appropriate to grant the relief sought by the Appellant i.e., to quash all the complaints. In such cases, the proper course for Magistrates is to use their statutory powers to direct an investigation into the allegation. Therefore, it is not the task of the criminal law to punish individuals merely for expressing unpopular views.', 'In conclusion, it can be said that this judgement of the Supreme Court is based upon a fact which the framers of the Constitution also recognized: that is the importance of safeguarding the freedom of speech and expression since the free flow of opinions and ideas is essential to sustain the collective of the citizenry. Also, an informed citizenry is a precondition for meaningful governance as it promotes the open dialogue between the government and society.', '']

The facets of expenditure, depreciation, allowances, payment of interest, etc. are dealt with by section 32, 37, 38, 39 and 40 of the Act of 1948. All these areas function on the amount collected through tariff which the corporation imposes on its consumers.', 'On 1st September 2000, the Damodar Valley Corporation (hereinafter referred to as Corporation)\xa0had\xa0notified\xa0its\xa0own\xa0tariff.\xa0 On 10th June 2003 the Electricity Act, 2003 came into force. The Corporation didn’t approach to CERC regarding\xa0fixing tariff even after the enactment of the Act of 2003. \xa0On 29th March 2005, the proceedings were started by the CERC suo moto and the corporation was directed by CERC to submit the documents and application related to determining the tariff from 1st April 2004 to 31st March 2009 which has to be imposed on consumers.', 'The CERC for determining tariff for the period being in question created the impression that taking into account the “multifaceted nature or complexity” of the issues in question, the CERC had mentioned one of its individuals to go into the vital fact-finding exercise and to present a report of the point by point realities that would be significant for determining tariff by the CERC.

Soliciting Damodar Valley Corporation to contribute out from its own assets would commensurate to denying it the return on equity as guaranteed as far as Tariff Regulations. In any case, in the event that we take a look at it from the perspective of the consumers, especially the commercial and industrial ones, have now no alternative to modify their deal cost to contemplate the requirement for meeting the aggregated liability. Hence, it is an acknowledged certainty that due to delaying the formation of such funds, the consumers were getting a charge out of lesser tariff than the real tariff applicable to them.', '“The views of the authors are personal“', '', '']

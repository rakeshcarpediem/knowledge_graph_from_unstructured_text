['A PIL was filed before the Hon’ble Telangana High Court on encroachment of water bodies in the Nirmal District of Telangana. A Bench of Hon’ble Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Hon’ble Justice B.Vijaysen Reddy with a dissenting tone asked the municipal authorities what measures were being taken up by them to prevent illegal encroachments on lakes.\xa0', 'Six months ago, when the hearing began, the Hon’ble court ordered the immediate removal of illegal constructions on the buffer zone and full tank level(FTL) areas of\xa0 6 lakes situated in the Nirmal district. But the authorities failed to comply with the orders and sought time to ‘immediately remove encroachments’ for which the Hon’ble Chief Justice asked what they meant by “immediate” after giving 6 months previously. The Bench found fault with the Collector for not constituting a lake protection Committee to remove the illegal structures in the vicinity of lakes.\xa0', 'The Hon’ble Court directed the authorities to file the fresh affidavit on how they would link different streams and sales and to ensure that they were not encroached upon. The matter was posted on July 29.', '']
